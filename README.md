# Diabetes-Prediction-System
The objective of this project is to diagnostically predict 
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.







## About Dataset

 
The dataset is provided by @MeriSKILL during my internship as a Data Analyst intern .This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are 
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


 




## Details

For this project, I used a variety of machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can predict whether a person is at risk of developing diabetes. I trained the model on the dataset which contained information about the following factors:
Glucose level,BMI,Age,BloodPressure,Other health conditions.
The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 78% on a held-out test set, which is very promising for a first project
